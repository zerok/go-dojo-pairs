In the game of pairs you are presented with a set of cards consisting of
duplicates. These are placed at random on a grid. In each turn each player picks
two cards. If they are a match, the player can keep them and take another
turn. If they two cards don't match, its the other player's turn.

The game ends once all pairs have been discovered and therefore there are no
cards left on the table. The player with the most found pairs wins.

In this implementation we have first a package called "game" where the actual
game logic is implemented. A very simple user-interface is provided within the
"simplegameserver" package which allows two people on the same screen to play
the game.


## Dojo guide

During the dojo, implementing the "game" package will be the main
objective. This should be done in a way that it can be used by the
simplegameserver application later on.
